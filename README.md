# Point Cloud Registration with Spatial and Color Data

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing point cloud registration by integrating spatial (geometric) and color (intensity) information for improved alignment accuracy. Utilizing both spatial and color attributes allows for more precise alignments, beneficial in datasets with distinct color patterns.
